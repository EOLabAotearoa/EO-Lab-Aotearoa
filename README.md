# EO-Lab-Aotearoa
# Earth Observation Lab Aotearoa

**Aotearoa’s | New Zealand's nexus for collaborative earth observation and data-driven decisions.**

## About Us

**Earth Observation Laboratory Aotearoa** seeks to establish a Laboratory for Earth Observation (EO), supported by **Te Pūnaha Ātea | Space Institute** and **Ngā Ara Whetū | Centre for Climate, Biodiversity & Society**, in collaboration with the **Centre for E-Research**. Our mission is to be Aotearoa’s nexus for collaborative earth observation and data-driven decisions.

This effort aligns with the objectives of the New Zealand government’s **National Space Policy**. We are committed to inclusivity and welcome all who want to join this community—breaking down barriers within and beyond the field.

## Core Activities

### 1. **Community**  
- Professional, contributing partners (**Hoamahi**).
- Stewards, problem holders (**Kaitiaki**).

### 2. **Te Ao Māori**  
- Engagement with and acknowledgement of **indigenous knowledge**.
- Addressing data sovereignty in the EO domain.

### 3. **Resources**

- **Education**: Capacity building for EO-driven problem solving across all levels and sectors of New Zealand. From free curated content and University-led micro-courses to professional training, we are provider-agnostic—if it’s good, we enable it.
  
- **Equipment**: Breaking down silos around equipment within the network across New Zealand, enabling greater utilisation and faster scientific advancement. This fosters a start-up ecosystem and better solution deployment throughout society.
  
- **Data**: We support **open data sharing** with realism—acknowledging that not all data should be shared widely. However, we aim to work with partner organisations to enable **data discovery** and usage.

- **Software**: We encourage the development of **open-source tools** focused on New Zealand that address geospatial data and leverage **machine learning (AI)** applied to EO data.

## Strategic Plan

### 1-2 Years (Setup Phase)
Funded by the **University of Auckland Office of Research Strategy and Integrity (ORSI)** with support from **Ngā Ara Whetū**, this phase focuses on:
- Building the community.
- Identifying needs and current capabilities.
- Appointing a **Māori co-director**.
- Initiating small-scale partnership projects, educational materials, and outputs to build trust and demonstrate success.

Projects will prioritize the **commercial sector** and **Iwi** as key partners.

### 2-5 Years (Expansion Phase)
To accelerate EO data use in New Zealand, we will seek long-term support from **government** and **industry**. A small team of full-time staff will have an outsized effect by building capacity across New Zealand’s economy and social structure.

Our strategy follows the **‘open core’ business model**, where free services grow capacity, while commercial users contribute to the ecosystem's sustainability.
